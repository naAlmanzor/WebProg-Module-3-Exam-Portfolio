                    <h1>Camel Wrestling Festival</h1>
                    <p class="left-align" style="width:540px; margin-top: 5%;">Camel wrestling isn’t as prevalent across Turkey as it used to be & is now confined mainly to the Aegean region of the nation, along the western and the west seacoast. Each January close to Ephesus, one of Turkey’s most well known archaeological sites, a camel wrestling event takes place. Mostly a couple of male camels, called as bulls, have the chance to battle over a lovely female camel, called as a cow. This is one of the most popular festivals in Turkey</p>
    
                    <p class="left-align" style="width:540px; margin-top: 5%;">The camel wrestling festival in Selcuk is one of the most famous festivals and takes place every year in January. Camel wrestling has its origins in the nomadic tribes of Anatolia where camels were a part of daily life. The locals breed and train the male camels specifically for wrestling. These camels must be of a certain type, known as Tulu Camels.</p>

                    <p class="left-align" style="width:540px; margin-top: 5%;">Cappadox, a progressive multi-disciplinary cultural festival that brings together a range of international and local contemporary art, music, nature and outdoor programs in the dramatic landscape of Cappadocia in the Central Anatolian province of Nevşehir, will be held between May 18 and 21. The festival is celebrated annually since 2015 amidst the beautiful landscape of Cappadocia. The festival is known for featuring international artists including Mercan Dede, Rhye, Ilhan Ersahin, Acid Pauli, and more! This place offers one of the best food festivals in Turkey. The festival also includes gastronomic treats, with chef Mustafa Otar inviting Cappadox attendees to leave modern cooking methods aside and set forth to the place where everything started. Through the Open Fire in Nature event, in which all ingredients are organic and the entire cooking procedure involves organic materials like ash, soil, wood and rocks, Otar will take guests to the origins of taste.
