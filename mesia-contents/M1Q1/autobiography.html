                <p class="justify" style=width:400px>I am John Joshua Cuizon Mesia, 20 years of age and taking the course Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Malayan Colleges Mindanao Davao City. I really do like anything about computer not only the games but technically the whole computer itself. I am amazed on what it can do and how it developed throughout the years. Before I was told to take up medicine course and as much as I like to help people I can't bear to watch people suffering and since the human body is so complex that there are circumstances that there is much nothing you can do about it even if you do your very best, that is why I told myself that it is better to fix technologies because if it really doesn't work then you can throw it away and buy a new one than saving a life where one mistake could lead to death.

                    In my free time I like to play games that requires critical thinking and team coordination, it is the only thing that I can engage with other people because in person I really don't talk too much. I do like math and that is why I am really into innovation and robotics that is why I decided to take Computer Science. I join competetions in National Science and Math Quest that is held every year and in 4 years I make the region proud by grabbing first place.

                <p class="justify" style="margin-top: 20px;"> I also received awards by being the best innovator with my colleagues we invented an electric generator that is able to charge a mobile phone and speaker for tricycle drivers. Since the mode of transportation in our municipality is tricycle that is why we come up with an idea that by just using their tricycle they can produce electricity.

                Now I am starting to learn AI and Machine Learning in my free time because this is my plan all along starting when I decided to take Computer Science than any Engineering course. I really want to pursue creating robots and improve the modern technology especially security, I want to create a machine that can be used by people in danger, it will notify immediately the nearby policemen and police station where the cctv camera nearby will flash in their screen so that they can immediately assess the situation and would create a strong evidence. This will be my great creation in the near future.
